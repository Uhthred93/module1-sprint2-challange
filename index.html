            <p>Jordan Bernt Peterson (born 12 June 1962) is a Canadian psychologist, author, and media
                commentator.[4][5] He began to receive widespread attention in the late 2010s for his views on cultural
                and political issues, often described as conservative.[6][7][8][9] Peterson has described himself as a
                classic British liberal[10][11][12] and a traditionalist.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>From July 1993 to June 1998,[29] Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and
                conducting research at Harvard University, where he was hired as an assistant professor in the
                psychology department, later becoming an associate professor. During his time at Harvard, he studied
                aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse.[26] An article in The Harvard Crimson said he possessed
                a "willingness to take on any research project, no matter how unconventional".[21] While at Harvard, he
                switched his primary area of research from familial alcoholism to personality and authored several
                academic papers.[30][31][32][33][34][35] Author Gregg Hurwitz, a former student of Peterson's at
                Harvard, has cited Peterson as an inspiration of his, and psychologist Shelley Carson, former PhD
                student and now-professor at Harvard, recalled that Peterson's lectures had "something akin to a cult
                following", stating, "I remember students crying on the last day of class because they wouldn't get to
                hear him anymore."[36] Following his associate position at Harvard, Peterson returned to Canada in 1998
                to become a full professor at the University of Toronto.[</p>

            <h2>Works</h2>
            <h3>Maps of Meaning (1999)</h3>

            <p>Main article: Maps of Meaning
                In 1999, Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, in which Peterson
                describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs, and make
                narratives. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, draws concepts from various fields
                including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and psychology, in accordance to the modern
                scientific understanding of how the brain functions.

                According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why individuals and groups alike participate in
                social conflict, exploring the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief
                systems (i.e. ideological identification) that eventually result in killing and pathological
                atrocities such as the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp, and the Rwandan
                genocide. Influenced by Jung's archetypal view of the collective unconscious in the
                book, Peterson says that an "analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe
                our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality."

                In 2004, a 13-part TV miniseries based on Peterson's book aired on TVOntario.</p>


            <h4>Rules for Life (2018)</h4>
            <p>Main article: 12 Rules for Life
                In January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An
                Antidote to Chaos, in which self-help principles are discussed in a more accessible style than in
                his previous published work. The book topped best-selling lists in Australia, Canada,
                France, Germany, the US, and the United Kingdom.

                To promote the book, Peterson embarked on a world tour.</p>

            <h5>Order (2021)</h5>
            <p>Main article: Beyond Order

                Peterson's third book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, was released on 2 March 2021. On 23
                November 2020, his publisher Penguin Random House Canada (PRH Canada) held an internal town hall
                where many employees criticized the decision to publish the book.</p>
